Data professional with a wealth of experience in impactful data-driven projects and with proven track record in leading successful data and analytics teams.

Currently, I manage the Product Analytics unit at Bitpanda, a leading European fintech specialised in cryptocurrencies and tokenised assets. In the course of my career, I have worked in several application fields — SaaS, intelligent transport systems, IoT, smart cities, geographical analytics, human mobility, computer network monitoring — filling the gap between technology and business impact.

The years spent in R&D centres and my PhD studies in Data Mining and Machine Learning at TU Wien completed my hands-on profile with a theoretical and research attitude. During my PhD, I have co-authored more than 30 research publications in major international conferences and journals.
