    Data professional with a wealth of experience in impactful data-driven projects and with proven track record in building and leading successful data and analytics teams.

<p style="text-align:left">
    Currently, I manage the Product Analytics unit at Bitpanda, a leading European fintech specialised in cryptocurrencies and tokenised assets. 
    In the course of my career, I have worked in several fields (crypto, SaaS, telecommunications and others) bridging technology and business impact.

    The years spent in R&amp;D centres and my PhD studies in Data Mining and Machine Learning at TU Wien completed my hands-on profile with a theoretical and research attitude. 
    During my PhD, I have co-authored 30+ publications in international conferences and journals.
